# Multi_class_student_performance_prediction
➢ Problem Statement:  
The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict the student performance.
Predicting students’ performance is mostly useful to help the teachers and students to improve their teaching and learning performance. Multi class student performance prediction system aims to predict a student’s performance based on input given by teachers or students and analyzed the performance of four machine learning algorithms on educational dataset used for the early prediction of student performance. This project not only predict the failure of the students but also categorizes them according to their levels. That is this project will elaborate on student performance prediction techniques and give a comparative study among them.
